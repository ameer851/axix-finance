# Vercel Deployment Fix

This document describes the changes made to fix the Vercel deployment issues (August 4, 2025).

## Issues Fixed

1. **Node.js Version Configuration**:
   - Reverted to Node.js version 18.x in package.json
   - Initially updated to 22.x, but received error: "Found invalid Node.js Version: 22.x"
   - Note: Although Node.js 18.x is listed as deprecated in warnings, it appears to be required for compatibility with the current Vercel configuration

2. **Output Directory Configuration**:
   - Changed the build script to use the default Vite output directory
   - Updated vercel.json to point to the correct output directory
   - Fixed error: "No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed"

3. **Build Process Streamlined**:
   - Simplified the build command to ensure proper output structure
   - Ensured compatibility with Vercel's deployment process

## Manual Testing Steps

Before pushing to production, test the deployment with these steps:

1. Run the build command locally: `npm run build`
2. Verify that the output is correctly generated in the `dist` directory
3. Install the Vercel CLI if not already installed: `npm install -g vercel`
4. Test the deployment locally: `vercel --prod`

## Package Compatibility Notes

Some dependencies require Node.js 20.0.0 or higher:

- react-router@7.6.0
- react-router-dom@7.6.0
- undici@7.13.0

These should work correctly with our updated Node.js 22.x configuration.

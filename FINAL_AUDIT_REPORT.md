# Final Audit & Remediation Report

Date: 2025-09-20

Scope: Investment returns processing, financial integrity, environment validation, auditability, operational reliability.

## 1. Objectives

- Prevent premature recognition of earnings into user available balances (post-cutoff policy).
- Guarantee atomic investment completion (principal unlock + earnings credit + archival) with transactional safety when direct DB available.
- Provide immutable audit trail for all balance / active deposit mutations.
- Ensure daily returns cron is idempotent, observable, and recoverable.
- Strengthen environment validation & feature gating.
- Expand testability & schema integrity verification.

## 2. Key Implemented Components

### Financial Ledger (Immutable)

- Table: `financial_ledger` (hash chained: previous_hash + payload -> entry_hash)
- Captures: balance_delta, active_deposits_delta, resulting balances, entry_type, metadata.
- Integration Points:
  - User balance adjustments
  - Active deposit adjustments (including moveWithBalance logic)
  - Investment completion payout (principal + accrued earnings)
- Service: `server/financialLedger.ts` with `record()` & `verifyChain()`.

### Transactional Investment Completion

- Added conditional transactional path in `investmentService` if `SUPABASE_DB_URL`/`DATABASE_URL` present (direct pg connection).
- Sequence inside transaction:
  1. Lock investment & user rows.
  2. Compute completion payout amounts.
  3. Adjust active deposits (unlock principal) and credit earnings.
  4. Archive snapshot to `completed_investments`.
  5. Insert ledger entry.
- Fallback to non-transactional when direct DB unavailable (still consistent but without row-level locking guarantees).

### Daily Returns Job Hardening

- Shared runner (`shared/dailyInvestmentJob.shared.js`) producing structured JSON logs with correlation fields.
- Job ledger table: `job_runs` records per-day execution, counts, totals, errors; uniqueness enforces idempotence by day.
- Admin endpoints to trigger, inspect status, and paginate historical runs.
- Cron script now thin wrapper delegating to shared logic; improved observability & DRY.

### Post-Cutoff Earnings Policy Enforcement

- Investments starting on/after cutoff no longer credit daily earnings to balance; earnings accumulate internally and only credit upon completion along with principal.
- Balance endpoints now return `adjustedAvailable` excluding accrued-but-not-yet-paid earnings.

### Environment Validation & Capabilities

- Extended `server/env-check.ts` to validate:
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (required in production)
  - `SUPABASE_DB_URL` / `DATABASE_URL` (enables transactional completions)
- Capability flags exported via `server/capabilities.ts`:
  - `hasServiceRole`
  - `canDirectDb`
  - `transactionalCompletions`
- Structured log includes capability snapshot at startup.

### Async Handler Wrapper & Logging Parity

- Added `wrapAsync` to standardize error propagation.
- Withdrawal route refactored; logging events for hold, transaction creation, notifications, and error states.

### Schema Integrity Tooling

- `scripts/schema-diff.mjs` compares expected schema definitions with live database, exiting non-zero on mismatch for CI gating.

### Testing Infrastructure

- Vitest config with Supabase in-memory mock tables.
- Initial tests for investment creation validations and duplicate prevention.
- Foundation laid for upcoming ledger & cron idempotency tests.

## 3. Security & Integrity Gains

| Area                  | Before                                         | After                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Earnings Crediting    | Daily credit risked double-count on completion | Single atomic credit at completion (post-cutoff)            |
| Investment Completion | Multi-step non-atomic                          | Transactional (when direct DB) with ledger entry            |
| Audit Trail           | Sparse logs only                               | Append-only hash chained ledger + job_runs                  |
| Cron Reliability      | Manual / opaque                                | Idempotent daily run + admin trigger + structured telemetry |
| Env Assurance         | Basic required vars                            | Capability-aware validation & gating                        |
| Testing               | Minimal manual checks                          | Automated unit tests + schema diff script                   |

## 4. Remaining / Deferred Items

- Add periodic ledger integrity verification endpoint (scheduled or admin-triggered).
- Add OpenAPI-generated client bundle & deeper test coverage (cron edge cases, ledger chain verification).
- Introduce distributed lock / advisory lock for multi-instance cron safety (if scaling horizontally).
- Expand admin UI to surface last job run health & quick re-run action.
- Add alerting (e.g., on missing daily job past SLA) via external monitoring.

## 5. Operational Playbook Highlights

- Daily Job Verification: check `job_runs` for today's row (success=true, counts > 0 when investments active).
- Ledger Inspection: query recent entries by `user_id` ordered desc; verify hash chain periodically.
- Transactional Mode Toggle: provide `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) to enable row-level locked completions.
- Emergency Re-run: Use admin POST `/api/admin/investments/run-daily?dryRun=0` (idempotent if already applied today).
- Schema Drift: run `node scripts/schema-diff.mjs` during CI; resolve mismatches before deploy.

## 6. Risk Mitigation Mapping

| Risk                         | Mitigation                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Double crediting earnings    | Policy cutoff + adjustedAvailable calculation     |
| Partial completion updates   | Transactional path + ledger snapshot              |
| Silent cron failures         | job_runs + structured logs + admin manual trigger |
| Undetected schema drift      | schema-diff script                                |
| Unauthorized privileged ops  | Production enforcement of service role key        |
| Opaque financial adjustments | Hash-chained ledger entries                       |

## 8. Validation Summary

- Build: (Pending in this run; to execute via `npm run build`)
- Tests: Initial suite passes (future expansion planned).
- Manual Spot Checks (recommended post-deploy):
  1. Trigger manual daily job in dryRun, confirm no ledger balance adjustments.
  2. Force-complete an investment ensuring single ledger credit & archive entry.
  3. Verify env validation log shows transactionalCompletions=true in production when DB URL present.

## 9. Conclusion

Core financial correctness, auditability, and operational reliability objectives have been met. Remaining enhancements are iterative hardening and documentation breadth. System now supports forensic reconstruction of balance evolution and controlled, idempotent daily accrual processing.

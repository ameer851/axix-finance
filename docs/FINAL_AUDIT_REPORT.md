# Final Audit Report – Axix Finance

Date: 2025-09-20

## Scope Covered

1. Automated cron job execution (daily returns) – implemented with `node-cron` in a dedicated worker.
2. Balance correctness – separation of available balance vs. earned (uncredited) returns.
3. Investment plan completion logic – transfer principal + earned on completion, archive, adjust active deposits.
4. Structured logging & observability – added `server/logger.ts`, request correlation, balance & active deposit mutation logs, cron logs.
5. Environment validation – fail-fast startup via `server/env-check.ts`.
6. API hardening – added validation and try/catch wrappers to multiple user, balance, transaction, and investment endpoints.
7. Integration lifecycle script – `scripts/test-investment-lifecycle.mjs` for manual smoke of deposit→investment flow.
8. Immutable financial ledger with hash-chain verification (`financial_ledger` + admin verify endpoint + CLI).
9. OpenAPI 3.1 specification (`docs/openapi.yaml`) with validation & type generation pipeline.
10. Standardized error handling (central middleware + consistent JSON error shape).
11. Daily job health & historical introspection endpoints.

## Key Files Added

- `server/cron-jobs.ts` – scheduled job runner.
- `server/logger.ts` – structured JSON logger (levels + correlation ids).
- `server/request-logger.ts` – HTTP middleware for per-request logs.
- `server/env-check.ts` – environment sanity validation.
- `scripts/test-investment-lifecycle.mjs` – lifecycle test helper.
- `docs/FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` – this report.
- `server/financialLedger.ts` – append-only ledger service with chain verification.
- `scripts/verify-ledger.mjs` – CLI integrity checker.
- `docs/openapi.yaml` – formal API contract (versioned).
- `scripts/validate-openapi.mjs` – lightweight structural spec validator.
- `shared/api-types.ts` – generated (via `npm run spec:types`).
- `tests/ledgerIntegrity.test.ts` / `tests/ledgerCorruption.test.ts` – integrity & tamper detection tests.
- `tests/transactionalCompletion.test.ts` – transactional completion fault injection smoke.
- `server/wrapAsync.ts` – standardized error utilities & middleware.
- `server/admin-routes.ts` – extended with job status/runs/health endpoints.

## Key Files Modified (Highlights)

- `server/routes.ts` – added validation & error handling for core endpoints; balance response refactor.
- `server/index.ts` – integrated structured logging, env validation, replaced ad‑hoc logging middleware.
- `server/storage.ts` – added structured logging for balance & active deposit adjustments; timestamp insertion fix on transaction creation.
- `server/investmentService.ts` – hardened `createInvestmentFromTransaction` (idempotence, plan validation, user resolution) and improved error semantics.
- `server/index.ts` – mounted standardized error middleware and normalized 404s.
- `server/routes.ts` – converted scattered error responses to centralized `createHttpError` pattern; added `/admin/ledger/verify`.

## Financial Logic Changes

| Concern                      | Previous Behavior                          | New Behavior                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily returns handling       | Mixed crediting vs. completion-based logic | Cutoff-based: legacy investments credit daily, new ones accrue until completion                     |
| Balance vs Earned separation | Possibly conflated in UI                   | API now returns `availableBalance`, `totalEarned`, `activeDeposits` distinctly                      |
| Plan completion              | Partial / inconsistent                     | Principal + accrued earnings transferred; active deposits decreased atomically; investment archived |

## Logging Model

All logs are structured JSON with fields: `ts`, `level`, `msg`, optional `cid`, `ctx`, `err`.

Important events:

- Request cycle: `REQ` / `RES` with duration & user id.
- Balance adjustments: `balance.adjust`, failures as `balance.adjust.fail`.
- Active deposit adjustments: `activeDeposits.adjust` / `.fail` / `.exception`.
- Cron execution: defined in `cron-jobs.ts` (info + error).
- Server errors: `Server error` with stack for non-production.

## Environment Validation

Fails startup if any required variable is missing or malformed: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV`.
Optional warnings for: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `FLY_APP_NAME`.

## Security & Hardening Improvements

- Correlation IDs enable tracing across logs & potential external APM tools.
- Input validation (numeric ID checks, presence checks) added to multiple endpoints.
- Reduced reliance on implicit behavior (explicit plan id mapping; prevents accidental invalid plan creation).
- Rate limiting already present; request logging now compatible with future anomaly detection.

## Operational Considerations

| Area            | Status    | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Migrations      | Manual    | Drizzle connectivity issues; manual SQL path documented previously. Ensure production DB reflects new numeric columns & earned field. |
| Email subsystem | Present   | Consider feature flag if `RESEND_API_KEY` absent.                                                                                     |
| Cron worker     | Automated | Verify Fly `[processes]` has worker binding correct compiled path.                                                                    |
| Observability   | Basic     | Consider shipping logs to a centralized store (Vector / Loki / Logtail) for retention + analytics.                                    |

## Remaining Risks / Follow Ups

1. Migration verification: Run schema diff to confirm production DB matches new schemas (ledger, completed investments, job_runs).
2. Full DB transaction encapsulation for investment completion (current fault injection paths rely on partial rollback semantics).
3. Enhanced ledger scalability: replace fallback select with server-side streaming or cursor-based iteration; remove RPC placeholder.
4. Deeper service-layer unit tests (mock Supabase) for `investmentService`, ledger record & error paths.
5. Per-user ledger verification scheduling (periodic sample integrity check + alerting).
6. Withdrawal approval pipeline structured logging parity & email failure alerting.
7. Rate limit & auth coverage in OpenAPI (security scheme references on all protected paths) continuous enforcement audit.
8. Add alerting for stale daily job health (e.g., webhook or email if stale=true beyond threshold).
9. Expand OpenAPI examples & error response enumerations for client SDK ergonomics.
10. Introduce before/after financial snapshot hashing for compliance layering atop ledger.

## Quick Validation Checklist (Completed)

- [x] Cron scheduling present
- [x] Structured logger functional
- [x] Request middleware integrated
- [x] Env validation halts on misconfig
- [x] Balance separation implemented
- [x] Investment creation hardened
- [x] Lifecycle script present

## Suggested Next Phase Enhancements

1. Domain service modularization (extract investment + ledger orchestration for isolated unit testing).
2. Automated alerting + dashboard widgets (ledger corruption summary, daily job health trend).
3. Background job idempotency lock (DB uniqueness already partly present; consider distributed lock for multi-instance scale).
4. Compliance layer: before/after balance snapshot hashing + external notarization (optional) of daily ledger root hash.
5. Client SDK generation pipeline consuming OpenAPI types (publish versioned package).

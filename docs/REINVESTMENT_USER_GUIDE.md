# Reinvestment Feature: User Guide

## What is Reinvestment?

Reinvestment allows you to move funds from your available balance into new investment plans, helping your money grow more efficiently by compounding your returns.

### Benefits of Reinvesting

- **Instant Activation**: Reinvestment is processed immediately with no waiting period
- **No Fees**: There are no transaction fees for reinvesting funds
- **Compound Growth**: Reinvesting profits can significantly increase your overall returns
- **Simplified Process**: No need to withdraw and deposit - directly transfer funds to investments
- **Diverse Portfolio**: Create multiple investments with different plans to balance risk and returns

## How Reinvestment Works

1. **Funds are transferred** from your available balance to active deposits
2. **A new investment** is created with your selected plan
3. **First profit is scheduled** for 24 hours after reinvestment
4. **Daily profits accumulate** according to your chosen plan
5. **When the investment completes**, profits are added to your available balance
6. **Original amount returns** to your available balance after plan duration

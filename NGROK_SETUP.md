cd c:\Users\BABA\Documents\CaraxFinance
.".\ngrok v3\ngrok.exe" http 4000
```

### Enhanced Configuration
Create an ngrok configuration file for better setup.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
- The ngrok tunnel will expose your local application to the internet
- Make sure your admin credentials are secure
- Consider using ngrok's basic auth feature for additional protection
- Monitor ngrok dashboard for traffic

## üì± Sharing with Client
Once ngrok is running, you'll get:
- A public HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
- A public HTTP URL (e.g., http://abc123.ngrok.io)
- Share the HTTPS URL with your client

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Free ngrok URLs change every time you restart ngrok
- For persistent URLs, consider upgrading to a paid ngrok plan
- The tunnel will only work while your local server and ngrok are running

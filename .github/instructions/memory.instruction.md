# User Memory

## User Preferences

- Programming languages: TypeScript, JavaScript
- Code style preferences: Concise, robust error handling, avoid placeholders
- Development environment: VS Code on Windows, PowerShell shell
- Communication style: Short, direct, and actionable

## Project Context

- Current project type: Full-stack web app (client + API)
- Tech stack: Vite client, Express API, Supabase backend; migrated from Vercel to Fly.io (Dockerized)
- Architecture patterns: Consolidated serverless function for all /api routes, SPA client, service-role backed admin routes
- Key requirements: Stable signup, eliminate invalid JSON responses, stay under Vercel Hobby function limits, strict CORS allowlist

## Coding Patterns

- Preferred patterns and practices: Centralized fetch wrapper with safe JSON parsing; service-role operations on server only
- Code organization preferences: Single /api/server.ts route aggregator, client services in client/src/services
- Testing approaches: Build locally, smoke test API endpoints (/api/health, /api/ping), then end-to-end signup
- Documentation style: Brief checklists and summaries in repo docs (FIXES_APPLIED.md, FINAL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md)

## Context7 Research History

- Libraries researched: Vercel rewrites/serverless routing; Supabase admin client usage server-side; Fly.io Dockerfile and fly.toml best practices; Fly.io custom domains and certificates; Supabase Auth server-side verification (getClaims, getUser); UTC date handling for Node/TypeScript
- Best practices discovered: Use JSON 404 for unmatched /api; avoid anon client writes against RLS-protected tables; prefer same-origin /api to bypass preview auth pages; for custom domains prefer A/AAAA on apex and CNAME on subdomains; ensure IPv6 present or use DNS-01 ACME CNAME; Cloudflare proxy requires AAAA-only + Full SSL; verify bearer tokens using provider-backed introspection (getClaims/JWKS) with network validation fallback (getUser); normalize comparisons to UTC start-of-day and use `<=`/`<` for scheduled-date checks
- Implementation patterns used: POST /api/auth/create-profile using service role; prune extra api files on Vercel to limit functions; Express middleware attempts local verify (if secret) → supabase.auth.getClaims(token) → supabase.auth.getUser(token); investment returns selection where `first_profit_date <= todayUTC` and `last_return_applied < todayUTC`; set `last_return_applied = todayUTC` after accrual
- Version-specific findings: Vercel v2 project config uses rewrites to route /api and /api/(.\*) to a single function entry; Supabase JS v2+ supports `auth.getUser(access_token)` and `auth.getUser()` with `Authorization: Bearer`, and `auth.getClaims()` for JWT claims without full user fetch

### 2025-09-15 — Timezone & Scheduling References

- Supabase/Postgres time storage best practices: Prefer TIMESTAMPTZ and use explicit UTC boundaries when filtering ranges. Reference: Bytebase guide “How to store time in PostgreSQL - using TIMESTAMPTZ”.
- Fly Machines scheduled runs: Use `--schedule` with cron expressions like `0 2 * * *` and monitor via `fly machines list` / `fly logs`. Reference: Fly.io Docs “Working with Machines — Scheduled Machines”.
- Currency formatting: Use `Intl.NumberFormat` with `{ style: "currency", currency }`. Reference: MDN Intl.NumberFormat.

### 2025-09-15 — Investment Email Notifications

- Implemented two emails: Daily Increment and Plan Completed.
- Server hooks: `server/investmentService.ts` calls `sendInvestmentIncrementEmail` and `sendInvestmentCompletedEmail` from `server/emailService.ts`.
- Templates: `server/emailTemplates.ts` added `generateInvestmentIncrementEmailHTML` and `generateInvestmentCompletedEmailHTML` using brand colors/images.
- Cron script: `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` now uses shared branded templates from `shared/emailTemplates.shared.js` and sets `X-Axix-Mail-Event` headers when sending via SMTP (Resend supported).
- Env requirements: RESEND_API_KEY + EMAIL_FROM (or SMTP_HOST/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASSWORD/SMTP_PORT); FRONTEND_URL for links.
- References: Resend SMTP with Nodemailer (host smtp.resend.com, user resend, pass API key) — <https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nodemailer-smtp>; Nodemailer testing guidance (single transport module) — <https://nodemailer.com/smtp/testing/>

### 2025-09-16 — Webhook + E2E test for emails

- Webhook endpoint: Added POST `/api/email/webhooks/resend` in `server/routes.ts` that records incoming Resend events into `audit_logs` (action = `resend_webhook`).
- 404 fix: Also registered a top-level handler in `server/index.ts` and Vercel `api/server.ts` so `/api/email/webhooks/resend` responds 200 on both Fly and Vercel, preventing JSON 404 `{ path: "/email/webhooks/resend" }`.
- Storage fix: `server/storage.ts` createLog now writes snake_case columns (`user_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `created_at`) to match DB schema.
- Automated E2E test: `scripts/test-investment-emails.mjs` seeds a test investment (first_profit_date = today UTC SOD), runs the processor, then polls `audit_logs` for matching subjects and recipient; queries `created_at` and orders descending.
- NPM scripts: `npm run cron:run` and `npm run test:emails` added.
- References: Resend Managing Webhooks (setup, retries, 200 OK) — <https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/webhooks/introduction>; Resend blog overview — <https://resend.com/blog/webhooks>.

### 2025-09-16 — Admin Audit Logs + Dashboard KPI

- Admin API: Added GET `/api/admin/audit-logs` with filters `action` (e.g., `resend_webhook`), `search` (matches details.to/subject), and pagination via `page`/`limit`.
- Storage: Uses `storage.getAuditLogs` and `storage.getAuditLogCount` with ILIKE on details JSON and action filter.
- Admin UI: New page at `/adminv2/audit-logs` with filters and table showing Time/Action/Description/To/Subject; linked from AdminV2 sidebar; protected by admin guard.
- Investments KPI: Added GET `/api/investments/total-earned` returning `{ totalEarned }` (sum of `investments.total_earned` for current user).
- Client Dashboard: New "Total Earned" card wired to the endpoint and refresh action; integrated into `NewDashboard.tsx` stats.

### 2025-09-16 — Investment Lifecycle Completion & History

- Daily Profit Rule: Profits accrue as `plan.dailyProfit% * principal_amount` per UTC day; first accrual respects `first_profit_date` at UTC SOD.
- Cap by Duration: Accruals stop after `planDuration` days (counter uses `days_elapsed`).
- Principal Unlock: On completion, principal is unlocked by decreasing `users.active_deposits` and moved back to available balance (atomic via `adjustUserActiveDeposits(moveWithBalance: true)`).
- Archival: Added `completed_investments` table to snapshot finished investments with totals and dates.
- Endpoints:
  - GET `/api/investments/active` → current user's active investments
  - GET `/api/investments/history` → current user's completed investments
- Client UI: New `InvestmentsPage` with tabs Active/History available at `/investments` and `/client/investments` inside DashboardLayout.
- Migration: `migrations/20250916_create_completed_investments.sql` creates history table and indexes.

### 2025-09-17 — Reinvest insert & accrual bug fix

- Symptom: After submitting a reinvest, no investment row appeared and accrual never started.
- Root causes:
  - Transactions table stores `user_id` as auth UID (string) in the snake_case path; `investments.user_id` is INTEGER → insert failed silently/returned null.
  - `plan_duration` was inserted from `transaction.plan_duration` (e.g., "3 days"), but the `investments.plan_duration` column is INTEGER.
  - `getUserInvestmentReturns` queried camelCase columns (`userId`, `returnDate`) which don't exist.
- Fixes implemented:
  - In `server/investmentService.ts#createInvestmentFromTransaction`, map `transactions.user_id` (uid) → numeric `users.id` via a lookup, and insert that in `investments.user_id`.
  - Store `plan_duration` as a number (using plan.duration) instead of a string label.
  - Keep `first_profit_date` null on creation; `scheduleFirstProfit()` sets it to the next UTC SOD and `applyDailyReturns()` respects it.
  - Fix `getUserInvestmentReturns` to use snake_case (`user_id`, `return_date`).
- Validation: `npm run build` passes; added `scripts/diagnose-reinvest-insert.mjs` to validate insert mapping for a given transaction id.

### 2025-09-18 — Cron processor deployed & scheduled

- Deployed corrected `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` to Fly (app: axix-finance); health at `/api/health` returns `{ ok: true }`.
- Scheduled Machine created: name `daily-investment-returns`, region `iad`, schedule `daily`, image tag `deployment-01K5D2NX5THK0SFWNAMAD45XW3`.
- Behavior: Runs once per UTC day; applies returns using UTC SOD guard, writes `investment_returns`, updates `investments` and `users.balance`, completes and marks `status="completed"` at duration.
- Monitoring:
  - List machines: `fly machines list -a axix-finance --json`
  - View logs: `fly logs -a axix-finance` (filter for `auto-investment-processor` messages) or target instance by ID.
- Manual validation steps (production): After a run, verify in Supabase:
  - `select * from investment_returns where return_date >= date_trunc('day', now() at time zone 'utc') order by created_at desc;`
  - Check an affected `investments` row: `days_elapsed`, `total_earned`, `last_return_applied = today UTC SOD`, `first_profit_date = null` after first day; `status='completed'` when counter reaches duration.
- Email: If SMTP/Resend configured, daily increment emails will send using shared templates with header `X-Axix-Mail-Event: investment-increment`.

### 2025-09-18 — Verification endpoints & scripts

- Added verification endpoints for same-day summaries (UTC SOD):
  - GET `/api/investments/returns/today` (auth) → `{ todayUtc, count, sum, completionsCount }` for the current user
  - GET `/api/admin/returns/today` (admin) → global `{ todayUtc, count, sum, completionsCount }`
- Added CLI script `scripts/verify-completions-today.mjs` and npm script `verify:today-completions` to list and summarize `completed_investments` for today.
- Existing `scripts/verify-today-returns.mjs` complements this for `investment_returns`.

### 2025-09-18 — Dashboard summaries for today

- Client Dashboard: Added a "Today's Earnings" stat tile on the user dashboard (`client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx`). It calls GET `/api/investments/returns/today` and displays sum and count for the current UTC day.
- Admin Dashboard: Added a "Today's Returns (UTC)" card on AdminV2 dashboard (`client/src/pages/AdminV2/dashboard.tsx`). It calls GET `/api/admin/returns/today` and shows sum, count, and completionsCount.
- Refresh behavior: Both widgets hook into the existing Refresh action so admins/users can refetch quickly after the daily run.

### 2025-09-18 — Earnings payout policy change

### 2025-09-18 — Adjusted Available Balance & Client Refactor

- Server now computes and returns `adjustedAvailable` on both `/users/:id/balance` and `/balance` endpoints, subtracting accrued earnings for post-cutoff active investments.
- Admin endpoint added: `POST /api/admin/reconcile/post-cutoff-earnings` with `{ userId?, dryRun? }` to calculate/apply balance normalization; writes to `audit_logs` when applied.
- One-off CLI: `scripts/reconcile-post-cutoff-earnings.mjs` with flags `--apply` and optional `--user <id>` mirrors the same logic and logs.
- Client Dashboard (`client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx`) refactored to remove client-side adjusted-balance math and active investments fetch; now uses `balance.adjustedAvailable` for display and reinvest validation; optimistic cache updates also adjust `adjustedAvailable`.
- Build status: ✅ vite v6 builds successfully; dynamic/static import warning remains non-blocking.

- Business rule: Earnings are no longer credited to user balance daily; they are credited in full only when an investment completes.
- Cutover: Applies to investments whose `start_date >= 2025-09-18T00:00:00Z`. Older investments (pre-cutoff) retain legacy daily credit behavior to avoid double-credit transitions.
- Server changes:
  - `server/investmentService.ts#applyInvestmentReturn`: Added cutoff flag; skips daily balance credit for post-cutoff investments; on completion, unlocks principal and credits `total_earned` to the user's balance.
  - `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js`: Mirrors the same cutoff; no daily balance updates post-cutoff; credits earnings at completion after principal unlock; keeps inserting `investment_returns` and updating `investments.total_earned` daily for tracking.
- Verification impact: Today's returns endpoints still show `investment_returns` sums and counts; balances for post-cutoff investments won't increase daily, but will jump on completion day by the total earnings plus unlocked principal.
- Email content: Increment emails still reflect accrued amounts and totals; completion emails implicitly indicate total payout (principal + totalEarned). Consider updating copy to clarify payout timing in a later iteration.

## Conversation History

- Important decisions made: Consolidated to single Express function; removed deprecated auth helper endpoints; added create-profile route; tightened CORS; **COMPLETELY REMOVED LEGACY ADMIN PANEL** - migrated to AdminV2 only
- Recurring questions or topics: Signup JSON parse errors; Vercel function limits; visitors feature removal
- Solutions that worked well: JSON 404 for /api; server-side profile creation; exact /api rewrite; **successful legacy admin cleanup** with proper redirects maintained
- Things to avoid or that didn't work: Client anon inserts into RLS tables; hard-coding cross-origin API base to preview domain

## Notes

- **Current Issue (2025-09-02)**: Two fixes needed for client dashboard reinvest section

### 2025-09-27 — Completion Emails Not Sent (Resolved)

- Symptom: Daily job completed 3 investments but completion emails were not delivered.
- Root cause: `shared/dailyInvestmentJob.shared.js` attempted to dynamically import `../server/emailService.js` from a JS context; only TS file existed, so in cron context it no-oped the send path. Also, cron wrapper did not pass a `sendEmail` function even though the shared job supported it.
- Fixes:
  - Injected send function: `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` now passes `sendEmail({ to, subject, html, headers })` using a preconfigured Nodemailer transport (Resend SMTP or SMTP\_\* envs).
  - Shared job updated to use injected `sendEmail` first and fall back to server emailService only if not provided. It also uses `shared/emailTemplates.shared.js` for subjects and HTML.
  - Added one-off tool `scripts/resend-completion-emails-today.mjs` and npm alias `email:resend:completions:today` to resend completion emails for entries in `completed_investments` since UTC SOD.
- Verification: `npm run verify:today-completions` showed 3 completions; `npm run email:resend:completions:today` sent 3 emails via Resend SMTP with messageIds logged.
- Env flags referenced: `DAILY_JOB_INCREMENT_EMAILS` ("true" to enable), `DAILY_JOB_COMPLETION_EMAILS` (set to "false" to disable), `RESEND_API_KEY` or `SMTP_HOST/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASSWORD` must be set; `EMAIL_FROM` used for from address.
  - ✅ Add list of investment plans similar to deposits page (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ Fix reinvest from account balance to include plan selection and ensure proper deduction/transfer (COMPLETED)

### 2025-09-28 — Cron reliability & cost control

- Removed in-process startup catch-up runner from `server/cron-jobs.ts` to avoid unintended extra runs and potential duplicate job_runs.
- Consolidated to a single 02:00 UTC schedule via node-cron inside the main server process.
- Removed the separate Fly `cron` process from `fly.toml` `[processes]` to prevent running an additional machine (cost saver); rely on in-app scheduler.
- Updated `package.json` default `build` to invoke `build:full` so `dist/server` and client assets copy are always prepared for production.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build:server` succeeded; manual require of cron bundle fails without env (expected).
  - `npm run job:health` shows last run at 02:00 UTC with success=true; today returns present; no completions today.

### 2025-09-28 — Early increments audit

- Added CLI `scripts/audit-early-returns.mjs` to detect investment_returns where `created_at` precedes `return_date` by a configurable threshold (default 60 minutes).
- NPM alias: `audit:early-returns` with flags `--days <n>` and `--threshold-min <n>`.
- Ran `npm run audit:early-returns -- --days 21 --threshold-min 30` in production environment; result: Found 0 early return(s) within the last 21 days.
- Follow-up: If a specific investment/date is reported, use `scripts/rollback-early-increment.mjs` to surgically revert that day.

- **Database Migration Required**: active_deposits column missing from users table (PENDING - requires manual SQL execution in Supabase)
- **Root Cause**: reinvestFunds call missing planName parameter (FIXED - already implemented)
- **Impact**: Reinvestment fails due to missing plan validation and database column (PARTIALLY FIXED - client-side ready)
- **Fix Applied**: Added plan selection dropdown and plans list UI to reinvest section
- **Build Status**: ✅ FIXED - Resolved duplicate selectedPlan declaration, build now passes successfully
- **Next Steps**: Apply database migration manually, test reinvestment with real data

### 2025-09-13 Updates

- Implemented camelCase/snake_case compatibility for active deposits end-to-end
  - Server balance payload returns numeric `activeDeposits` reading `(user.activeDeposits ?? user.active_deposits)`
  - Reinvest response returns `data.user.activeDeposits` with the same fallback
  - Server storage adjust method writes to `activeDeposits` or `active_deposits` based on detected user schema
  - Admin stats aggregation now sums `activeDeposits ?? active_deposits`
  - Client NewDashboard mapping reads `activeDeposits ?? active_deposits`
  - Client reinvestFunds parses `res.data.user.activeDeposits ?? active_deposits`
- Build Status: ✅ Passed (vite build) after changes
- Deployment: Pending; Fly CLI on Windows previously errored on auto-update; consider running deploy from admin PowerShell or CI/WSL

### 2025-09-16 — Client Dashboard Investments Tabs & Calculator

- New client pages planned: Investment History and Track Investment under client dashboard; ensure Investment Calculator displays authoritative plans and accurate values.
- Routing: Add routes `/investment-history`, `/client/investment-history`, and `/track-investment`, `/client/track-investment`; keep `/investment-calculator` existing.
- Sidebar: Add side tabs for Investment History and Track Investment within `DashboardLayout` nav; ensure consistent styling.
- Calculator: Use server `/investment/plans` and `/investment/calculate` to render actual plans (STARTER, PREMIUM, DELUX, LUXURY) with min/max, daily %, duration, and totals. Fix label from "monthly return" to "daily return".
- Tracking: Track page will search both active and completed investments by ID, also matching `original_investment_id` for history.

### 2025-09-16 — History ID column, deep-link, filters & smoke test

- Investment History page now shows an explicit ID column and client-side filters (ID/Plan) with simple pagination (10/page).
- Added an Actions column to both Active and History tables with a “View in tracker” deep-link to `/track-investment?id=<id>`.
- Track Investment page enhanced with URL param auto-search, loading indicator, empty state, and not-found guidance.
- Added `scripts/smoke-client-routes.mjs` to verify main client routes respond with 200 and expected markers; documented usage in `docs/LOCAL_TESTING.md`.

### 2025-09-14 Updates

- Dashboard UX: Added optimistic cache update after reinvest so Active Deposits updates instantly on the dashboard; still follows with invalidate+refetch for confirmation
- Files touched: client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx
- Build: ✅ Passed (vite v6) and bundle generated
- Deploy: ✅ fly deploy --now succeeded; app healthy at /api/health
- Expected UX: After reinvest, Active Deposits increases immediately without needing a manual refresh; Available Balance decreases accordingly

### Deployment Workflow (2025-09-13)

- Added GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`
  - Triggers on `workflow_dispatch`
  - Builds with Node 20 and runs `npm run build`
  - Uses `superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl`
  - Deploys with `flyctl deploy --app axix-finance --now --remote-only`
- Required secret: `FLY_API_TOKEN` in GitHub repo settings
- Post-deploy step pings `https://axix-finance.fly.dev/api/ping` (falls back to `/health`)

### 2025-09-24 — Starter Cap, Reinvest Insert Robustness, and Backfill Tool

- Business rule: Starter Plan reinvests are limited to 2 per user (lifetime); other plans have no limit.
- API enforcement: POST `/api/transactions/reinvest` now checks count of prior completed reinvest transactions for `STARTER PLAN` using the user's uid and description prefix `Reinvest -`. If count >= 2, returns 403 with `code: STARTER_REINVEST_LIMIT` and a friendly message.
- Bug fix: `createInvestmentFromTransaction` previously relied on a missing planId at call sites, causing failed inserts (leaving funds locked without an investment). Implemented a robust `createInvestmentFromTransactionRecord(txId, planId?, { skipActiveDepositsIncrement })` that:
  - Loads transaction and infers plan by `planId` or `plan_name`
  - Resolves numeric `users.id` from `transactions.user_id` (uid string allowed)
  - Stores `plan_duration` as a number (parsing "3 days" if needed)
  - Optionally skips `increment_user_active_deposits` when reinvest already moved funds
  - Returns `Investment | null`, with a wrapper preserving `{ success, investment?, error? }` for existing tests and admin flows
- Call sites updated:
  - Reinvest endpoints now pass `plan.id` and `{ skipActiveDepositsIncrement: true }`
  - Admin approval path keeps wrapper and schedules first profit after create
- Backfill: Added script `scripts/backfill-missing-investments.mjs` to create investments for recent completed transactions with plan data that lack an investments row. Usage: `npm run backfill:investments` (requires SUPABASE_URL + SERVICE_ROLE_KEY envs). Optional env: `DAYS=7 LIMIT=50`.
- Client UX: Reinstate friendly error propagation; `client/src/services/transactionService.ts#reinvestFunds` throws `Error(message)` from API, displaying the Starter cap message.
- Tests: Investment service unit tests passing; ledger integrity tests still require runtime env (expected). Build passes with existing Vite dynamic import warning.

## Deposit Logic Fix (2025-09-12) ✅

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: External deposits were incorrectly being moved to activeDeposits instead of available balance

### Root Cause

- Admin approval logic in `server/admin-api.ts` was checking for `planName` and moving external deposits to `activeDeposits`
- This prevented users from accessing their deposited funds immediately

### Solution Implemented

- Modified admin approval logic to always credit external deposits to `available balance`
- Only internal transfers (via `/transactions/reinvest` endpoint) should move funds to `activeDeposits`
- Updated notification message to clarify that funds are added to available balance
- Updated console logging to reflect corrected behavior

### Files Modified (Aug 20)

- `server/admin-api.ts` - Fixed deposit approval logic to credit available balance instead of activeDeposits

### Expected Behavior

- External deposits (crypto/bank transfers) → Available balance (user can spend or reinvest)
- Internal transfers (reinvest) → Active deposits (locked for investment returns)
- Users get immediate access to deposited funds
- Reinvestment requires explicit user action via reinvest endpoint

### Validation

- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ API compiles without errors
- ✅ Logic now matches intended user flow

## Issue (2025-08-20)

- User reports persistent 404 error for `/api/admin/users` and sign-up page cannot connect to server.
- Client fetches `/api/admin/users` and receives `{ message: "Not Found", path: "/api/admin/users" }`.
- CORS and network errors also observed for Supabase auth refresh.
- File `client/src/pages/AdminV2/layout.tsx` reviewed; no issues found in layout.
- Next steps: Research API routing and deployment best practices, investigate codebase for `/api/admin/users`, check server/client connectivity, validate API route existence and server build status.

## Issue Resolution (August 20, 2025) ✅

**PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Fly.io deployment API health check failures and visitor activity 404 errors

### Root Cause and Solution

1. **Health Check Response Format**:
   - **Issue**: Client expected `{ status: "ok" }` OR `{ ok: true }` but server returned only `{ status: "ok", serverTime: "..." }`
   - **Solution**: Updated `/api/health` endpoint in `server/auth.ts` to return comprehensive format: `{ status: "ok", ok: true, ts: Date.now(), serverTime: "..." }`
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now passes all client validation checks

2. **Visitor Activity Session Management**:
   - **Issue**: PUT `/api/visitors/activity` returned 404 `{ ok: false, message: "Session not found" }` when no session existed
   - **Solution**: Modified visitor activity endpoint to auto-create sessions if they don't exist
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now returns 200 `{ ok: true, lastActivity: timestamp }`

3. **Deployment & Integration Status**:
   - **Domain Integration**: ✅ WORKING - Custom domain fully integrated with Fly.io
   - **API Endpoints**: ✅ ALL WORKING - Health, ping, visitor tracking all responding correctly
   - **Build Process**: ✅ WORKING - Successfully built and deployed via Docker
   - **Performance**: ✅ GOOD - Fast response times, rate limiting active

### Validation Results

- `/api/health` → `{ status: "ok", ok: true, ts: 1755652468901, serverTime: "2025-08-20T01:14:28.901Z" }`
- `/api/ping` → `{ ok: true, ts: 1755653453891 }`
- `/api/visitors/activity` (PUT) → `{ ok: true, lastActivity: 1755653294095 }`
- Main site loading successfully in browser
- All health check validations passing

### Files Modified

- `server/auth.ts` - Enhanced `/api/health` response format
- `server/visitor-routes.ts` - Added auto-session creation for activity updates
- Deployed via `npm run build && fly deploy`- Root cause and mitigations (2025-08-18, later):
  - Root cause: Environment variable VITE_API_URL in production contained pasted CLI commands (semicolons, spaces, '%20'), producing requests like '/vercel%20env%20rm.../api/ping' which returned 308/HTML and broke JSON parsing
  - Mitigation: Implemented defensive sanitizer in client/src/config.ts (resolveApiUrl) to reject VITE_API_URL values with whitespace, semicolons, or encoded spaces and fall back to '/api'
  - Refactor: Replaced direct uses of import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL across client (lib/api.ts, services/api.ts, services/emailService.ts, services/authService.ts) to route via sanitized config.apiUrl
  - Validation: Local production build passed; all references now use config.apiUrl; this prevents malformed paths even if Vercel env var remains incorrect
  - Operational follow-up: Optionally correct or remove VITE_API_URL in Vercel to a clean origin or leave unset to prefer same-origin '/api'

- Migration to Fly.io (2025-08-18):
  - Added Dockerfile (multi-stage) to build server and client; copied client build to dist/server/public; runtime CMD runs dist/server/index.js on PORT 8080
  - Added fly.toml with internal_port 8080, HTTP health check at /health, and concurrency limits
  - Updated server to bind 0.0.0.0 when FLY_APP_NAME is present and default to PORT 8080 in production; broadened CORS to allow \*.fly.dev
  - Updated api/server.ts CORS allow \*.fly.dev and PORT default 8080 for dev path
  - Hardened .dockerignore for smaller images; added docs/DEPLOY_TO_FLY.md
  - Next steps: Set Fly secrets (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, FRONTEND_URL/SITE_URL), run `fly launch --no-deploy` then `fly deploy`

- Fly deployment fixes and outcome (2025-08-18, later):
  - Server bundling: switched esbuild output to CommonJS (format=cjs, out-extension .cjs) to avoid dynamic require issues with CJS deps (jsonwebtoken/safe-buffer)
  - Removed dotenv from server bundle and marked as external; rely on Fly secrets/env
  - Dev-only Vite: ensured Vite and @vitejs/plugin-react are dynamically imported only in development and marked external in server build
  - Vite path safety: replaced import.meta.url top-level in server/vite.ts with a baseDir that works in CJS/ESM
  - Health check: made /health fast and non-blocking; moved DB/email initialization async after listen; extended Fly http/tcp check grace periods
  - Binding: always bind to 0.0.0.0 in production
  - Docker: updated CMD to run dist/server/index.cjs
  - Deploy status: fly deploy succeeded; app reachable at <https://axix-finance.fly.dev/> and /health returns `{"status":"ok"}`

- Custom domains status (2025-08-19):
  - App IPs: A 66.241.125.177, AAAA 2a09:8280:1::91:23cd:0
  - Created certs for <https://www.axixfinance.com> and <https://axixfinance.com>; both pending due to DNS mismatch at current provider (vercel-dns/afeeshost)
  - Required DNS:
    - Apex: A @ → 66.241.125.177; AAAA @ → 2a09:8280:1::91:23cd:0 (or ALIAS/ANAME/CNAME flattening to axix-finance.fly.dev)
    - WWW: CNAME www → gk51k1w.axix-finance.fly.dev (or A/AAAA as above)
  - Optional ACME: `_acme-challenge.\<host\>` CNAME to `\<host\>.gk51k1w.flydns.net` for pre-issuance
  - Next: Update DNS, wait to propagate, then `fly certs check <host>` until Status=Ready

  - Live updates (2025-08-19, later):
    - Deployed latest server build to Fly; verified /api/ping 200 OK and homepage loads with CSP headers
    - Implemented and deployed /api/auth/create-profile backed by Supabase storage
      - Fixed storage insertion to support both snake_case and camelCase schemas and include uid on insert
      - Smoke test script scripts/smoke-create-profile.mjs returns 201 with created user
    - Certificates: `www.axixfinance.com` now Ready; `axixfinance.com` still Awaiting configuration (needs apex A/AAAA to Fly IPs)
    - Build task passes locally (vite + build-api.cjs); no compile errors

- Production redeploy and verification (2025-08-19, latest):
  - Ran `fly deploy --now`; image built (~181MB) and rolled out successfully
  - Live checks:
    - GET /api/ping → JSON { ok: true, ts: ... }
    - scripts/smoke-create-profile.mjs → 201 Created with user payload (server-side signup path healthy)
  - Client bundle fix for double "/api" deployed; main asset check indicates no "/api/api" occurrences
  - Current certs per "fly certs list" — <https://www.axixfinance.com> Ready; <https://axixfinance.com> Awaiting configuration (pending apex A/AAAA)
  - Next: Update apex DNS records to Fly IPs or use ALIAS; hard refresh cache after DNS propagates

### 2025-09-19 — Daily Investment Processor Missed Run Investigation

- Symptom: After 24h the automatic daily investment returns and related emails (increment / completion) did not execute in production.
- Observations:
  - No schedule configuration present in `fly.toml`; prior note referenced a scheduled Machine named `daily-investment-returns` but repository config does not declare machine scheduling (likely created manually via flyctl and image reference outdated after new deploy).
  - Cron script `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` lacked early environment diagnostics and granular per-investment logs, making post-mortem difficult.
  - Emails depend on SMTP/Resend; if not configured, silent skip occurs (transport null) — added explicit warning log.
- Actions Implemented:
  1. Enhanced logging in `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` (environment snapshot, query window, per-investment consideration metadata, missing transport notice).
  2. Added manual admin endpoint `POST /api/admin/investments/run-daily?dryRun=1` (in `server/admin-routes.ts`) to allow secure manual triggering of daily returns (idempotent by date guards).
  3. Updated Dockerfile to copy raw `scripts/` and `shared/` directories into runtime image ensuring cron execution environment has source (previously only `dist` was copied; cron script runs from source path when invoked via npm script or machine cmd).
  4. Added console log masking sensitive credentials lengths without printing secrets.
- Next Operational Steps:
  - Recreate/update scheduled Machine using latest image: `fly machine run <image> --schedule "0 0 * * *" -a axix-finance --region iad --command "node /app/scripts/auto-investment-processor.js"` (or build a launch template).
  - Verify logs after next run: `fly logs -a axix-finance | grep cron`.
  - Test manual trigger: `curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <adminToken>" https://axix-finance.fly.dev/api/admin/investments/run-daily`.
- Root Cause (Likely): Scheduled Machine not updated to latest deployment image (image tag drift) or not actually created/persisted; absence of schedule config in repo suggests out-of-band manual setup which was not maintained.
- Mitigation Outcome: Manual trigger + richer logs reduce MTTR; copying scripts ensures compatibility with machine command execution.

### 2025-09-19 — Job Ledger & Shared Runner Implementation

- Added persistent job ledger table `job_runs` via migration `20250919_add_job_runs_table.sql` with columns: `job_name`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `processed_count`, `completed_count`, `total_applied`, `success`, `error_text`, `source`, `meta`; uniqueness constraint `(job_name, started_at::date)` ensures one logical run per UTC day.
- Centralized processing logic in `shared/dailyInvestmentJob.shared.js` exporting `runDailyInvestmentJob(opts)` and lightweight JSON logger `jobLog()`; both cron script and admin manual trigger now re-use identical codepath → eliminates divergence.
- Refactored `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` to delegate to shared module; legacy per-investment logic removed (thin wrapper prints summary only).
- Admin endpoints added in `server/admin-routes.ts`:
  - POST `/api/admin/investments/run-daily?dryRun=1` → manual trigger (source="manual"; supports dry run)
  - GET `/api/admin/jobs/daily-investments/status` → returns last + previous run row and `stale` boolean (>26h)
  - GET `/api/admin/jobs/daily-investments/runs?page=&limit=` → paginated historical runs
- Structured JSON log events (examples: `start`, `found_investments`, `consider`, `investment_exception`, `summary`, `finalize_exception`). Filter via `job:"daily-investments"`.
- New operations guide `docs/DAILY_JOB_OPERATIONS.md` documents: scheduling a Fly Machine with cron (`--schedule "0 5 * * *"`), updating image digest, manual verification checklist, health check script pattern, recovery & rollback workflow.
- Build validated post-refactor (`npm run build` passed; Vite dynamic/static import warning unaffected).
- Next optional enhancement (not yet implemented): Admin UI widget to surface most recent run metrics + manual trigger button.
- Rationale: Provides observability (ledger + logs), idempotence (daily uniqueness), and easier recovery (single shared code path) reducing risk of silent missed accrual days.

### 2025-09-21 — Ledger Integrity, OpenAPI Expansion & Standardized Errors

- Added immutable `financial_ledger` with SHA-256 hash chaining (fields: previous_hash, entry_hash) ensuring tamper-evident sequence; service in `server/financialLedger.ts`.
- Implemented verification endpoint `GET /api/admin/ledger/verify` supporting optional `fromId`, `toId`, `sample` for full or sampled chain checks; CLI `scripts/verify-ledger.mjs` added.
- Expanded `docs/openapi.yaml` with comprehensive schemas (LedgerEntry, LedgerVerifyResult, JobRun, DailyJobHealth) and endpoints (ledger verify, job status/runs/health); removed `x-planned` markers for implemented paths.
- Added validation script `scripts/validate-openapi.mjs` and npm script `spec:check` to guard structural drift; introduced `spec:types` using `openapi-typescript` generating `shared/api-types.ts`.
- Standardized error handling: introduced `createHttpError` & centralized Express error middleware (`createErrorMiddleware`) mounted in `server/index.ts`; converted multiple route Handlers to throw typed errors with codes (e.g., INVALID_PLAN, INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS).
- Added daily job health endpoint `GET /api/admin/jobs/daily-investments/health` returning stale flag, last run, recent runs, statistical window metrics (successRate, avgProcessed, avgCompleted).
- Added synthetic integrity tests: `tests/ledgerIntegrity.test.ts` (shape) and `tests/ledgerCorruption.test.ts` (detects previous_hash break & entry_hash tamper); exposed internal verification helper & hash computation for test instrumentation.
- Fault injection: Transactional completion path includes env-driven failure points (`TEST_FAIL_AFTER_PRINCIPAL_UNLOCK`) to exercise atomicity invariants in tests.
- Documentation: Updated `docs/FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` with new features; created `docs/LEDGER_INTEGRITY.md` outlining operational guidance and future hardening.
- Follow-up priorities recorded: streaming verification optimization, periodic sampled verification scheduling, alert pipeline for stale job + ledger corruption, expanded OpenAPI examples, compliance snapshot hashing.

### 2025-09-21 (Later) — Ledger & Job Runs Listing + Earnings Backfill

- Added backfill migration `migrations/20250921_backfill_earned_money.sql` (Option B) to populate `users.earned_money` from aggregated `investment_returns` where still NULL/0.
- Implemented new admin list endpoints:
  - GET `/api/admin/ledger` → paginated ledger entries with optional filters (userId, entryType, referenceTable, referenceId; offset/limit <=200).
  - GET `/api/admin/job-runs` → paginated all job runs (not only daily investments) with optional filters (jobName, success; offset/limit).
- Updated AdminV2 UI `audit-logs` page to a tabbed interface (Audit Logs, Financial Ledger, Job Runs) with independent pagination state and tables.
- Extended `client/src/services/adminService.ts` with `ledger.list` and `jobRuns.list` methods.
- Expanded OpenAPI spec (`docs/openapi.yaml`) adding `/admin/ledger` and `/admin/job-runs` path definitions; regenerated `shared/api-types.ts` via `npm run spec:types` (installed missing dev dependency `openapi-typescript`).
- Performed production build validation (`npm run build`) — successful; only existing dynamic import warning remains (non-blocking).
- Created/updated memory file with latest architectural decisions for future context.
- Next follow-ups (not yet implemented): enforce stricter admin auth on new endpoints (role/claims), add client-side filtering controls, run backfill migration in production environment, add tests covering pagination & filter contract.
  - Update: Admin auth hardening implemented (role === 'admin' enforced) and client filtering controls added for ledger (userId, entryType, referenceTable, referenceId) and job runs (jobName, success). Added basic Vitest coverage for new admin endpoints (auth rejection & limit cap path). Existing unrelated investmentService tests currently failing in local run; investigate separately.

- API robustness update (2025-08-19, latest):
  - Added a JSON 404 catch-all for unmatched /api routes in server/index.ts to prevent HTML fallthrough
  - Verified health endpoints and visitor routes; client health check points to /api/health and accepts ok/status
  - Local build succeeded (vite + build-api.cjs); ready to deploy to Fly

### 2025-09-21 (Later Still) — Secret Scan Medium Finding Remediation

- Removed hardcoded test password literal `"testpassword123"` from `scripts/test-24-hour-profit-system.js` that triggered a MEDIUM generic-password finding in secret scan.
- Replaced with a generated ephemeral password (`Test-<rand>-P@55`) per run; password not logged; improves hygiene and removes static credential pattern from repository.
- Post-change secret scan: No high/critical findings; prior medium only informational after removal.

### 2025-09-24 — User Diagnostic & Reconciliation

- Added CLI `scripts/diagnose-user.mjs` to inspect a specific user's balances, active/completed investments, and discrepancies using shared math helpers. Added npm alias `diagnose:user`.
- Added CLI `scripts/reconcile-active-deposits.mjs` to recompute `users.active_deposits` from sum of active investments' principal; supports `--apply` to update. Added npm alias `reconcile:active`.
- Ran diagnostics for uid `bfa5037a-d21f-4d5a-8b75-fe34892e7d0a` (user id 84):
  - Active investments: 0; Completed: 1 (STARTER PLAN, principal 200, duration 3, daily 4%, total earned 24).
  - Balance: 616; active_deposits was 400 (stale) → reconciled to 0 to reflect no active investments; earnings credit-on-completion behavior verified.
- Follow-up: Consider adding an automatic ledger adjustment entry when reconciling active_deposits to maintain ledger completeness.

### 2025-09-24 — Daily Profit Audit & Repair Tool

- Added CLI `scripts/audit-fix-daily-profit.mjs` to scan recent investments for `daily_profit` deviations from plan rates (threshold 0.01) and optionally fix them.
- Usage:
  - Dry run: `npm run audit:daily-profit` (env: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY; flags: `--days 7` default)
  - Apply fixes: `npm run fix:daily-profit` (or `node scripts/audit-fix-daily-profit.mjs --apply --days 7`)
- Behavior:
  - Pulls investments where `created_at >= now - DAYS` and compares `investments.daily_profit` to the authoritative plan rate by `plan_name`.
  - Logs mismatches with id, plan, current vs expected, delta, principal; updates rows when `--apply` set (also touches `updated_at`).
- Rationale: Guarantees math consistency for newly backfilled/created investments so accrual and completion payouts align with plan definitions.

### 2025-09-25 — Manual Daily Run, Admin Router Mount & Build Metadata

- Executed manual daily investment run locally via `npm run cron:run` at `2025-09-25T01:10Z` applying returns to 3 active investments (processed=3, completed=0, totalApplied≈10.07).
- Discovered production 404 for `/api/admin/jobs/daily-investments/health` while `/status` worked → root cause: `admin-routes` not mounted in `server/index.ts` (modular admin-api only) in deployed image.
- Implemented mount: `app.use('/api/admin', adminRouter)` plus enumeration of job-related routes at startup (logs with `📋 Daily investment job admin routes:`) to verify presence in future deployments.
- Added build/version diagnostics:
  - Extracts package version and commit/image env vars → sets response headers `X-Build-Version`, `X-Build-Commit`, `X-Image-Ref` for every request.
  - Logs consolidated `Build Info` (version, commit, image, node version) early at startup.
- Added startup route enumeration to detect missing health/status endpoints proactively; future 404s now actionable via log diff.
- Next steps (planned): redeploy updated image to Fly, verify headers via curl, query `job_runs` for today to ensure single run, and add alerting if stale (>26h since last run).
- Added monitoring script `scripts/check-daily-job-health.mjs` with npm alias `job:health` producing JSON (stale flag, lastRun metrics) and `--strict` exit code support for CI alerting.

### Auth & JSON Handling Fixes (2025-08-22)

- Issue: Admin routes and deposit/withdraw APIs returning 401 with bearer mappingFailed despite Authorization header present.
- Root Cause: Supabase JWT verification failed when using anon key as secret; unsigned decode fallback limited to non-production causing mapping failure in production. Also double JSON stringification in `apiFetch` produced invalid JSON bodies leading to 400 parse errors server-side.
- Fixes Implemented:
  - Added production fallback controlled by `ADMIN_JWT_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=true` allowing unsigned decode for bearer mapping in `server/routes.ts` and `server/admin-api.ts`.

### 2025-09-21 — Secret Hygiene Completion & Follow-ups

- Secret scanner (`scripts/scan-secrets.cjs`) integrated; final scan shows NO high/critical findings (only high-entropy integrity hashes in lock files — informational).
- Removed committed secret material from `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.vercel`; replaced with placeholders (`__INJECTED_AT_RUNTIME__`).
- Eliminated hard-coded fallbacks in `server/auth.ts` (ADMIN password) and `server/supabase.ts` (Supabase keys, JWT secret).
- Pending Actions (external, not yet recorded as completed): Rotate exposed historical credentials (Supabase service role & anon if desired, JWT_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, DB password) and perform git history purge (filter-repo/BFG) before tagging a security-clean release.
- Planned CI: Add GitHub Action `secret-scan` to run on push/PR to main; block merges on high/critical findings; optionally cache `node_modules` for speed.
- Documentation To Add: Credential rotation checklist, git history purge procedure, allow-list guidance for acceptable entropy (lock file integrity fields) and public keys.
- Admin Observability: Financial ledger & job runs endpoints + UI tabs implemented with pagination & filters; next optional enhancement is automated ledger chain sample verification job & alerting on mismatch or stale job runs.
- Risk Register Updates: (1) Historical git leak until history rewritten, (2) Absence of automated key rotation schedule, (3) No alerting pipeline yet for ledger corruption detection.
  - Updated `client/src/utils/apiFetch.ts` to avoid double JSON encoding when caller already stringified body.
  - Rebuilt & deployed to Fly (`fly deploy --now`).
- Expected Outcome: Bearer tokens now map to `req.user`; admin endpoints (/api/admin/users, deposits, withdrawals) authorize correctly; deposit confirmation endpoint accepts properly encoded JSON.
- Next Steps: Ensure `ADMIN_JWT_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED` secret set temporarily; long-term obtain correct `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` or use Supabase GoTrue JWK verification.

## Deposit Logic Fix (2025-09-12) Summary ✅

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: External deposits were incorrectly being moved to activeDeposits instead of available balance

### Root Cause (Summary)

- Admin approval logic in `server/admin-api.ts` was checking for `planName` and moving external deposits to `activeDeposits`
- This prevented users from accessing their deposited funds immediately

### Solution Implemented (Summary)

- Modified admin approval logic to always credit external deposits to `available balance`
- Only internal transfers (via `/transactions/reinvest` endpoint) should move funds to `activeDeposits`
- Updated notification message to clarify that funds are added to available balance
- Updated console logging to reflect corrected behavior

### Files Modified (Summary)

- `server/admin-api.ts` - Fixed deposit approval logic to credit available balance instead of activeDeposits

### Expected Behavior (Summary)

- External deposits (crypto/bank transfers) → Available balance (user can spend or reinvest)
- Internal transfers (reinvest) → Active deposits (locked for investment returns)
- Users get immediate access to deposited funds
- Reinvestment requires explicit user action via reinvest endpoint

### Validation (Summary)

- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ API compiles without errors
- ✅ Logic now matches intended user flow

## Active Deposits & UI Fixes (2025-09-13) ✅

**PROBLEMS SOLVED**:

1. Active deposits not showing after reinvestment from account balance
2. Duplicate investment plan selection components on dashboard

### Root Cause (Detailed)

1. **Active Deposits Display**: Reinvest endpoint wasn't returning updated user data with activeDeposits, so frontend couldn't refresh the display
2. **Duplicate Components**: Two identical investment plan selection sections existed in NewDashboard.tsx

### Solutions Implemented (Round 1)

#### 1. Fixed Active Deposits Display

- Modified `/transactions/reinvest` endpoint in `server/routes.ts` to return updated user data
- Added proper null checks for transaction and user objects
- Fixed TypeScript errors for undefined variables
- Now returns fresh user balance and activeDeposits data after reinvestment

#### 2. Removed Duplicate Investment Plan Section

- Removed redundant "Investment Plans Preview" section from `client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx`
- Kept the functional "Investment Plans List" section
- Cleaned up duplicate code and improved UI consistency

### Files Modified (Round 1)

- `server/routes.ts` - Enhanced reinvest endpoint to return updated user data
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx` - Removed duplicate investment plan section

### Expected Behavior (Round 1)

- ✅ Reinvestment from account balance now properly shows in active deposits
- ✅ Only one investment plan selection component on dashboard
- ✅ Frontend receives fresh user data after reinvestment
- ✅ UI updates immediately after successful reinvestment

### Validation (Detailed)

- ✅ Client build passes successfully
- ✅ API server compiles without errors
- ✅ Deployment to Fly.io successful
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Application running at <https://axix-finance.fly.dev/>

## Active Deposits Display Fix (2025-09-13) ✅

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Active deposits not updating in UI after reinvestment from account balance

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Server Response Structure**: Reinvest endpoint was returning updated user data in `res.data.user.activeDeposits` but frontend service was looking for `res.data.activeDeposits`
2. **Query Cache Issues**: Frontend query cache wasn't being properly invalidated after reinvestment
3. **Data Flow**: Missing proper cache invalidation and debugging to track data flow
4. **Schema mismatch**: Database stores column as `active_deposits` (snake_case) while server originally read only `activeDeposits` (camelCase), causing zero in balance payload

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Frontend Service Response Parsing

- Updated `reinvestFunds` function in `transactionService.ts` to correctly parse `res.data.user.activeDeposits`
- Fixed response structure mismatch between server and client

#### 2. Enhanced Query Cache Invalidation

- Added explicit query cache invalidation using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
- Added debugging logs to track balance data after reinvestment
- Ensured fresh data is fetched from server after reinvestment

#### 3. Added Server-Side Debugging

- Added console logging in reinvest endpoint to track updated user data
- Logs show balance and activeDeposits values after database updates
- Helps verify that database updates are working correctly

#### 4. Schema Compatibility in API

- Updated balance builder and reinvest response in `server/routes.ts` to read `activeDeposits` with a fallback to `active_deposits`
- Removed duplicate `activeDeposits` key in balance response (previously returned both numeric and legacy string under the same key)

### Files Modified (Details)

- `client/src/services/transactionService.ts` - Fixed response parsing for updated user data
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard/NewDashboard.tsx` - Added query cache invalidation and debugging
- `server/routes.ts` - Added server-side debugging for reinvest endpoint

### Expected Behavior (Details)

- ✅ Reinvestment from account balance immediately updates active deposits display
- ✅ Frontend receives fresh user data with correct activeDeposits value
- ✅ Query cache is properly invalidated to prevent stale data
- ✅ Server logs show correct balance/activeDeposits updates
- ✅ UI refreshes automatically after successful reinvestment
- ✅ Balance endpoint consistently returns correct `activeDeposits` regardless of DB column casing

### Validation Steps

1. **Server Logs**: Check for `[reinvest] Updated user data:` logs showing correct values
2. **Browser Console**: Check for `Balance after reinvestment:` logs showing updated data
3. **UI Update**: Active deposits should immediately reflect reinvested amount
4. **Cache Verification**: Multiple reinvestments should show cumulative active deposits

### Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to dashboard with available balance
2. Enter amount to reinvest and select plan
3. Click "Reinvest Funds" button
4. Verify active deposits updates immediately
5. Check browser console for debugging logs
6. Check server logs for database update confirmation

The active deposits should now display correctly and update immediately after reinvestment from account balance.

### 2025-09-14 (Later) — Active Deposits placeholders removed

- Wired `client/src/pages/Client/DepositsListPage.tsx` summary cards to live balance via `useQuery(["userBalance", user.id], getUserBalance)` so they share cache/invalidation with the dashboard.
- Replaced "-" placeholders:
  - Active Deposits → `$${Number(balance?.activeDeposits||0).toFixed(2)}`
  - Total Invested → temporarily mirrors activeDeposits (principal locked); future enhancement: compute from investments table.
  - Total Earnings → left as `$0.00` until earnings aggregation is implemented.
- Build: ✅ Passed (vite v6). No hard-coded "100 USD" found across client; any such display would be a stale bundle/browser cache – advise hard refresh.

### 2025-09-15 — Auth reliability and returns timing

- Cross-device login issues mitigated by enhancing bearer mapping middleware
  - Strategy: Prefer Supabase introspection over local verification
  - Implementation: In `server/routes.ts` middleware, attempt `supabase.auth.getClaims(token)`; if needed, fallback to `supabase.auth.getUser(token)`; only then optionally decode without verification behind env flag.
  - Outcome: Tokens issued from various devices/browsers now map to `req.user` reliably even when local JWT secret is unavailable or rotated.
- Daily returns timezone robustness
  - Strategy: Normalize comparisons to UTC start-of-day and allow `first_profit_date <= today` instead of strict equality
  - Implementation: In `server/investmentService.ts`, compute `today` via `Date.UTC(...)`; selection uses `last_return_applied < today` and `first_profit_date <= today`; added debug logs per investment considered; in `applyInvestmentReturn`, treat first profit as `<= today`. Script `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` aligned to the same UTC boundary logic and updates `last_return_applied` to the UTC start-of-day.
  - Outcome: Cron/admin returns no longer skip first-day accruals due to timezone mismatch; safer against off-by-one errors around midnight.
  - Next: Smoke-test with a user having locked investments and monitor logs.

### 2025-09-15 — Investment System Fix Guide Execution

- Objective: Execute docs/INVESTMENT_SYSTEM_FIX_GUIDE.md end-to-end: create test investment, verify diagnostics, run processor, validate cron, and ensure UI shows both active investments value and count.
- Action Plan:
  1. Research up-to-date best practices (Supabase JS timezones, Fly.io cron Machines, React currency formatting)
  2. Audit code paths: `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js`, `server/investmentService.ts`, client investment dashboard components
  3. Add a safe test script to insert a test investment with UTC first_profit_date
  4. Run `scripts/check-investments.js` and processor (dry-run first), observe logs
  5. Update docs with verified commands and troubleshooting tips
- Decisions:
  - Use UTC start-of-day for `first_profit_date` and compare via `<= todayUTC`.
  - Prefer `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency display; keep formatCurrency helper as thin wrapper.
  - Reuse existing schema fallback: `activeDeposits ?? active_deposits` consistently in API payloads and UI.
  - For cron, prefer Fly Machines `--schedule` with explicit cron `0 2 * * *` and structured logs.
- Pending Verification:
  - Ensure `scripts/auto-investment-processor.js` updates `last_return_applied` to UTC SOD and logs each accrual.
  - Confirm client InvestmentDashboard shows both value and count; update if needed.
  - Validate environment variables available locally for running scripts (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).

### 2025-09-20 — Environment Capabilities, Ledger Hardening & API Spec Scaffold

- Environment Validation Enhancements:
  - Updated `server/env-check.ts` to derive capability flags: `hasServiceRole`, `canDirectDb`, `transactionalCompletions` (true when direct DB URL present) and emit structured JSON log on startup.
  - Added `server/capabilities.ts` providing accessor helpers (`hasTransactionalCompletions()`, etc.) to centralize conditional logic and prevent ad‑hoc env parsing throughout codebase.
  - Purpose: Make behavior (especially transactional investment completion path) explicitly discoverable and testable; prepares ground for feature gating (e.g., future read replicas, optional hashing strategies).
- Financial Ledger Integration:
  - Confirmed `financialLedger` service records entries for balance & active deposits mutations and completion payouts; integrated hash chaining (previous_hash + deterministic payload → entry_hash) enabling tamper detection.
  - Added initial test (`tests/ledgerAndCron.test.ts`) exercising a basic ledger record write + capability detection (still needs extended chain verification & negative integrity tests in future iteration).
  - Next Planned Tests (not yet implemented):
    - Chain continuity verification (recompute hash for sampled window & simulate corruption case).
    - Transactional vs non-transactional completion behavior path assertions (ensuring atomic payout only when capability true).
- Job Runs Observability:
  - `job_runs` table (migration `20250919_add_job_runs_table.sql`) now forms authoritative single-run-per-day ledger (unique on job_name + date) ensuring idempotency and enabling stale-run detection.
  - Shared runner logic consolidated (cron script + manual admin trigger) via shared module (added 09-19) reducing drift risk.
- Post-Cutoff Earnings Policy Reinforcement:
  - Capability logic makes it straightforward to enforce future transitional states (e.g., partial rollout of deferred-credit model) by gating sections where balance credits occur.
- Documentation Artifacts:
  - Added `FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` (comprehensive remediation & risk mapping) and `NEW_UPDATE_NOTES.md` (delta-focused release notes) to provide audit trail & deployment transparency.
  - Operations: `docs/DAILY_JOB_OPERATIONS.md` already guides scheduling/monitoring; future enhancement: add troubleshooting section referencing capability flags when daily job misbehaves.
- OpenAPI Scaffold:
  - Created `docs/openapi.yaml` (3.1 baseline) enumerating core endpoints (auth, health, investments, admin daily job trigger). Schemas minimal—requires expansion with investment, ledger entry, job run, and standardized error object definitions.
  - Intention: Serve as contract for future client/admin dashboard refactors and external integrators (manual trigger automation, auditing dashboards).
- Pending / Follow-Up Items (tracked for future updates):
  - Expand OpenAPI schemas & error models; include security scheme annotations for admin vs user endpoints.
  - Add ledger integrity verification endpoint (admin) returning chain status & first corrupted index if any.
  - Implement alert for stale daily job (`job_runs` gap > 26h) and expose via admin dashboard widget.
  - Add comprehensive ledger chain tests + corruption simulation.
  - Add test coverage for transactional vs fallback completion path using capability toggling.
  - Append memory again once these follow-ups are delivered to maintain continuity.
  - Ensure memory file remains synced after each structural observability enhancement.
  - Consider integrating a lightweight hash range audit script (CLI) for on-demand integrity scanning.

Summary: 09-20 focused on formalizing runtime capability introspection, strengthening the investment ledger's test surface, seeding API specification work, and documenting remediation outcomes for future audits.

### 2025-09-24 — Cron Missed Today (Hotfix Applied)

- Symptom: Daily cron did not run today (no `job_runs` entry and stale status observed).
- Hotfixes:
  - Added startup catch-up in `server/cron-jobs.ts`: on process boot, if no run exists for today and the last run is older than 26 hours (or never), immediately execute `runDailyInvestmentJob` with `source = "cron-startup"`.
  - Added a secondary safety schedule at `5 12 * * *` (12:05 UTC) that performs the same guarded idempotent check and runs with `source = "cron-safety"` if 02:00 UTC was missed.
  - Both paths check `job_runs` for today before executing to avoid duplicate accruals.
- Validation:
  - Built server bundle successfully (`npm run build:server`).
  - Local dry run via `npm run cron:dry-run` executed end-to-end with no errors (0 processed when nothing to do).
- Ops Notes:
  - Restarting the app will now self-heal missed runs via the startup catch-up.
  - Ensure Fly scheduled Machine (if used) is updated to the latest image digest; the in-process node-cron remains as a backup schedule.

### 2025-09-24 — Backfill for Missing Investments (Reinvest-Safe)

- Enhanced `scripts/backfill-missing-investments.mjs` to:
  - Detect reinvest transactions via `description` prefix `Reinvest -` and set `skipActiveDepositsIncrement = true` to avoid double-counting locked funds.
  - Support `DRY_RUN=1` to log intended creations without writing.
  - Schedule first profit date via `scheduleFirstProfit(investment.id)` after successful create for consistency with normal flows.

- Usage: `DAYS=7 LIMIT=50 DRY_RUN=1 npm run backfill:investments` (flip DRY_RUN to apply). Env required: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

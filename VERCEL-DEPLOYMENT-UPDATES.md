# Vercel Deployment Updates

## August 4, 2025 Changes

### Node.js Version Update

- Updated Node.js version from `18.x` to `22.x` in `package.json` to meet Vercel's requirements
- Node.js 18.x is being deprecated by Vercel as of September 1, 2025

### Build Configuration Updates

- Modified build scripts to explicitly set output directory to `public`
- Updated start scripts to point to the new output location
- Vercel configuration already had correct `outputDirectory` setting in vercel.json

### Fixed Issues

1. **Node.js Version Warning**
   - Fixed the warning: "Node.js version 18.x is deprecated. Deployments created on or after 2025-09-01 will fail to build."
   - Solution: Updated to Node.js 22.x in package.json

2. **Missing Output Directory Error**
   - Fixed the error: "No Output Directory named 'public' found after the Build completed."
   - Solution: Updated build scripts to explicitly use `--outDir public` parameter

### Dependency Notes

Some dependencies require Node.js 20.x or higher:

- `react-router@7.6.0` (requires Node.js >=20.0.0)
- `react-router-dom@7.6.0` (requires Node.js >=20.0.0)
- `undici@7.13.0` (requires Node.js >=20.18.1)

These dependency warnings should be resolved with the upgrade to Node.js 22.x.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application:

```bash
# Run the deployment command
npx vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Verify that the build outputs files to the `public` directory
2. Check that Node.js 22.x is being used during the build process
3. Review the Vercel build logs for any specific errors

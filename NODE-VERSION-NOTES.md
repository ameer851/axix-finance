# Node.js Version for Vercel Deployment

## Current Situation (August 4, 2025)

There appears to be a conflicting message regarding Node.js versions in Vercel:

1. **Initial Warning**:

   ```
   Error: Node.js version 18.x is deprecated. Deployments created on or after 2025-09-01 will fail to build.
   Please set "engines": { "node": "22.x" } in your `package.json` file to use Node.js 22.
   ```

2. **Deployment Error After Using 22.x**:
   ```
   Error: Found invalid Node.js Version: "22.x". Please set "engines": { "node": "18.x" } in your `package.json` file to use Node.js 18.
   ```

## Current Solution

- Keep using Node.js 18.x for now since it's required for successful deployment
- Monitor Vercel announcements for updates on Node.js 22.x support
- Plan to migrate to Node.js 22.x before September 1, 2025 (when 18.x becomes unsupported)

## Future Migration Strategy

1. Check Vercel documentation regularly for updates on Node.js 22.x support
2. Test deployments with Node.js 22.x in a staging environment
3. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Node.js 22.x
4. Complete migration before the September 1, 2025 deadline

## Package Compatibility Issues to Watch

The following packages require Node.js >=20.0.0 and may need updates or alternatives:

- react-router@7.6.0
- react-router-dom@7.6.0
- undici@7.13.0

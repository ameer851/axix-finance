# Vercel Deployment Checklist

After pushing your changes to GitHub and triggering a new Vercel deployment, follow these steps to verify the deployment:

## 1. Check Deployment Status

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (axix-finance)
3. Check the deployment status and logs
4. Verify there are no runtime errors

## 2. Test API Endpoints

1. Test the health endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
2. Test authentication: Login and register functions
3. Test user dashboard functionality

## 3. Verify Client App

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Check that all components load correctly
3. Verify that API requests work properly

## 4. Monitor Performance

1. Check page load times
2. Monitor API response times
3. Watch for any error reports in your logging system

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Function Timeout Errors**: Consider optimizing database queries
2. **CORS Issues**: Check your API response headers
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: Verify all required variables are set in Vercel
4. **Database Connection Errors**: Check database credentials and connection strings

Remember to check the serverless function logs in the Vercel dashboard for detailed error information.
